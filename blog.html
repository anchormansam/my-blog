<h1>Week 2 Questions</h1>

  <h3>
    What are your thoughts on Pseudo Coding?
  </h3>
    
    <p>
        Not sure what to think on Pseudo coding. I understand the concept of how it works. I believe the 
        flowchart may make it easier for those who are more visual. I
        am sure that as I continue to learn and grow I will better understand.  
    </p>

<h3>
     What are you struggling with?
</h3>
 
    <p>Currently struggling with connecting CSS stylesheet to lines of code. The more we learn to code the more lines
        we will have that will need to have styles different on each page. Still working on the concept of one stylesheet 
        and labeling it so that I understand where I am on the webpage for design. Also having a better feel for 
        the pull and push request for git using terminal.

    </p>

<h3>
        What are you excited or eager to learn more about?
</h3>
    <p>I am excited to learn the behind the scenes of a website. How to store data from a user as well as keep data 
        of inputs that I may do on the page so that I am not typing paragraphs into code. Building a website that deals with 
        e-commerce.

    <h1>Week 3 Questions</h1>

    <h3>
        What are your thoughts about the roles HTML, CSS, and Javascript play in the process of rendering content and providing user experience?
    </h3>
      
      <p>
          The role of HTMl seems to be the simpliest. This is what most users will be reading and seeing with their eyes. The main reason they came to the page. 

          The role of CSS is to make what was inserted on the page have a specific layout so that the page seems more appealing to the eye. Most users want a page
          that has some style to it but at the same time is easy to understand. 

          The role of Javascript is what will allow the user of the page to actually use the function of the page. This is what creates repeat visits. The information
          is nice to view on a page, however if the flow of the page and works seemlesly then the odds a person will be back to use the page will be more significant.
